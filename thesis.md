## Abstract

Financial Asset Recommendation (FAR) literature optimises ranking quality (nDCG, Recall) and realised return (ROI) without exposing whether recommendations are profile-aligned in the regulatory sense required by MiFID II suitability. This thesis introduces **Profile Coherence at k (PC@k)**, an evaluation metric that scores the share of a top-k list whose asset risk class lies within ordinal tolerance of the customer's declared MiFID II risk band, together with a band-conditional random baseline `pi(b)` that makes the metric interpretable across customer segments. Four questions are asked of FAR-Trans (Sanz-Cruzado et al., 2024) under this lens. **RQ1** audits how prevalent profile-discordance is in the observed Buy record: 18.6% of 228,241 scoreable Buys are discordant (`d > 1`), the per-customer distribution is sharply bimodal (64.4% fully coherent, 17.2% fully discordant), and the two extreme bands account for almost all of the discordance (Conservative coherent share 45.1%, Aggressive 56.2% versus 90% on Income and Balanced). **RQ2** asks whether discordant transactions are also worse trades: a transaction-level OLS over 208,029 priced Buys, controlling for asset volatility, customer segment, and year and clustered on `customerID`, finds that profile-coherent transactions earn **+2.94 percentage points** more 6-month forward return than profile-discordant ones (95% CI [+2.15, +3.72] pp, p < 1e-12). **RQ3** locates the FAR-Trans baselines on the new axis: at their primary-metric optima LightGCN attains aggregate PC@10 = 0.794 (PC-lift 1.17) and Random Forest attains PC@10 = 0.667 (PC-lift 1.06), but the model-level panel regression shows that LightGCN is below the random baseline for the Conservative band and Random Forest is below random for Conservative and Income, which together cover 60.9% of the eligible customer population. **RQ4** asks whether a stratified profile-coherent LightGCN extension can fix the deficit: training one LightGCN sub-model per declared risk band and adding a profile-coherent margin loss lifts aggregate PC@10 from 0.794 to **0.918** and PC-lift@10 from 1.17 to **1.40** (100% of 69 splits, paired wins) while moving every declared band from below or at random coverage to above (Conservative 0.484 → 0.774, lift 0.75x → 1.19x; Aggressive 0.473 → 0.692, lift 1.35x → 1.97x). The trade is roughly -2 pp nDCG@10 and -3 pp Recall@10, with aggregate ROI@10 -0.18 pp/month (paired t-test p = 3e-4, attributable to the stratified architecture itself rather than to the coherence loss, which is statistically flat). Per-band, ROI **improves** on the two regulator-critical bands the RQ3 audit flagged (Conservative +0.30 pp/month, Income +0.11 pp/month) and regresses on Balanced (-0.24 pp/month) and Aggressive (-0.78 pp/month), the sign-flipped reflection of the FAR-Trans macro window. The headline finding for the field is that profile coherence is not a regulatory tax: on FAR-Trans it co-moves positively with realised return at the transaction level, the existing baselines under-serve precisely the customer bands the regulation was designed to protect, and a profile-stratified extension can close the per-band coverage deficit and improve realised return on the bands where the deficit originally lived.

## 1. Introduction

Financial asset recommendation sits at the intersection of personalised ranking and regulatory obligation. The European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) requires investment firms to assess suitability before recommending a financial product. Suitability means alignment between the product's risk profile and the customer's declared risk tolerance, investment horizon, and capacity to absorb losses. A recommender that maximises predicted return without conditioning on the customer's risk band can be both an excellent ranker on standard benchmarks and a regulatory liability in deployment.

The FAR-Trans dataset (Sanz-Cruzado et al., 2024) is the first open benchmark for FAR that includes both customer profile metadata and a multi-year transaction history. It records 228,913 Buy transactions across 806 assets and 29,090 retail customers, alongside MiFID II declared risk bands for each customer and asset metadata sufficient to derive each asset's risk class through a hierarchical mapping. The accompanying paper benchmarks LightGCN, Random Forest, and several other recommenders on nDCG@10, ROI@10, and Recall@10. None of those metrics measures profile alignment, and none of the published baselines explicitly conditions on the declared risk band.

This thesis introduces a profile-alignment lens for FAR at three levels: a metric (PC@k), an audit of the FAR-Trans transaction record through that metric, and a comparative test of how the existing baselines behave on the new axis. The research questions answered here are:

- **RQ1** *(Diagnostic)*: How prevalent is profile-discordance in observed FAR-Trans Buy transactions, and is it customer-level trait or transaction-level noise?
- **RQ2** *(Quasi-causal)*: Do profile-discordant transactions earn lower realised 6-month return than profile-coherent ones, after adjusting for asset volatility, customer segment, and year?
- **RQ3** *(Audit)*: Where do the FAR-Trans baselines (Random Forest, LightGCN) sit on the PC@10 axis, and does any baseline match or exceed the band-conditional random baseline for every declared band?
- **RQ4** *(Method)*: Can a stratified, profile-coherent LightGCN extension (one sub-model per declared MiFID risk band, trained with a profile-coherent margin loss) improve PC@10 over the global LightGCN baseline, and at what cost to nDCG@10, Recall@10, and ROI@10? Does the gain vary by declared risk segment, and does the realised-return cost concentrate where the regulatory deficit lives or somewhere else?

The most surprising result is the per-band ROI@10 sign-flip under RQ4. The headline framing in the FAR literature (and the natural expectation when one adds a profile-alignment constraint to a return-maximising recommender) is that profile coherence costs return: it is a regulatory tax paid for compliance. On FAR-Trans the answer is the reverse, and the reversal is sharpest on exactly the bands the regulation was written to protect. The stratified profile-coherent extension *gains* +0.30 percentage points per month of realised return on the Conservative band and +0.11 pp/month on the Income band (the two sub-random bands the RQ3 audit flagged), and it *loses* return on the Balanced and Aggressive bands (-0.24 and -0.78 pp/month). The aggregate ROI penalty of -0.18 pp/month is therefore not a uniform tax: it is a slate-weighted average of a return-positive intervention on the regulator-critical bands and a return-negative intervention on the centre-and-upper bands, in a macro window where safer assets outperformed riskier ones over 2019-2025. For a deployment whose suitability requirement is binding, the per-band ROI direction is more informative than the aggregate: the recommender does not pay return to protect the bands the regulator most cares about, it earns return by protecting them.

The contributions of the thesis are: (i) a regulator-aligned coherence metric with a band-conditional normalisation; (ii) a customer-level audit of FAR-Trans that decomposes discordance by year, segment, and declared band; (iii) a transaction-level regression that quantifies the conditional return gap between coherent and discordant Buys; (iv) a model-level panel regression that locates each baseline on the PC@10 axis, by declared band, with cluster-robust standard errors clustered on `customer_id`; (v) a stratified profile-coherent LightGCN extension that closes the per-band coverage deficit on FAR-Trans, with a clean λ=0 versus λ=1 ablation that attributes the headline PC@10 gain to the coherence loss (+9.7 pp) and the residual cheap +2.7 pp to stratification alone; and (vi) a per-band ROI@10 decomposition of that intervention that documents the sign-flipped, regulator-aligned realised-return pattern: positive on Conservative and Income, negative on Balanced and Aggressive, with the small aggregate ROI penalty attributable to stratification rather than to the coherence loss.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Profile Coherence at k

Let `b_u in {0, 1, 2, 3}` be customer `u`'s declared MiFID II risk band, ordinally encoded as Conservative (0), Income (1), Balanced (2), Aggressive (3). Customer bands are read from FAR-Trans's `riskLevel` field: the four declared strings (`Conservative`, `Income`, `Balanced`, `Aggressive`) map to bands directly, and the four regression-imputed strings (`Predicted_Conservative` ... `Predicted_Aggressive`) get the same ordinal mapping with an `is_predicted` flag carried alongside; customers with `Not_Available` or a missing `riskLevel` have `b_u = None` and are excluded from the metric.

Each asset `i` is mapped to a risk band `b_i` via a hierarchical three-step rule (`build_asset_risk_classes` in `src/utils/profile_coherence.py`):

1. **Subcategory metadata first.** Mutual-fund (MTF) subcategories map as `Money Market → Conservative`, `Bond / Bonds → Income`, `Balanced → Balanced`, `Equity / Large Cap → Aggressive`. Bond subcategories map as `Government → Conservative`, `Corporate → Income`, with any other bond subcategory defaulting to Income.
2. **Volatility-quartile fallback for stocks.** A trailing 252-day annualised log-return standard deviation is computed per ISIN; the stock-only volatility distribution gives quartile cutoffs `(q1, q2, q3)`, and each stock is bucketed `Conservative` / `Income` / `Balanced` / `Aggressive` accordingly.
3. **Balanced default.** Assets that fall through both rules (typically stocks without enough price history to compute volatility) are assigned `Balanced`, the centre-of-distribution prior.

Pairwise discordance is the absolute ordinal distance:

```
d(u, i) = |b_u - b_i| in {0, 1, 2, 3}
```

A recommendation is **profile-coherent** under the default tolerance iff `d(u, i) <= 1`; a stricter variant uses `d(u, i) == 0` (exact band match) and is reported only as a sensitivity row in the EDA. PC@k for one user is the share of the top-k that is coherent:

```
PC@k(u) = (1/k) * |{i in top_k(u) : d(u, i) <= 1}|
```

Three implementation rules close out the per-user definition (`compute_profile_coherence_at_k` in `src/utils/metrics.py`). First, **truncation rather than padding**: a recommender that returns fewer than k items is scored on what it returned, so `len(top_k)` replaces `k` in the denominator if the slate is short. Second, **assets with no resolvable band count as discordant**: an asset whose `asset_id` is missing from the asset-band lookup contributes nothing to `coherent_count`. The Balanced default in step 3 of the asset-band rule means this is rare in practice, but the rule is conservative against unclassifiable items. Third, **customers without a usable MiFID risk band (declared or regression-imputed) are excluded** by setting their per-customer PC@k to zero, so the aggregate metric draws only on customers with a profile signal.

The aggregate **PC@k for a split** is the unweighted mean of per-customer PC@k across the eligible customers in that split; no slate-volume or band-population reweighting is applied. The thesis-level numerics then average over the 69 splits.

A uniformly-random recommender that samples assets ignoring customer profile achieves a band-conditional baseline that depends only on the asset-universe distribution:

```
pi(b) = |{i in A : |b - b_i| <= 1}| / |A|
```

On FAR-Trans, where the asset bands are distributed 190 / 333 / 105 / 178 across Conservative / Income / Balanced / Aggressive (from the EDA's `asset_band_distribution_by_category`), this gives `pi = (0.649, 0.779, 0.764, 0.351)`. The Aggressive baseline is the lowest because its tolerated set `{Balanced, Aggressive}` covers only 35.1% of the 806-asset universe; the Income baseline at 0.779 includes the three central bands. PC-lift@k normalises PC@k by the customer's band baseline:

```
PC-lift@k(u) = PC@k(u) / pi(b_u)
```

A lift of 1.0 means the recommender is no better than uniform sampling for that customer's band; values above 1.0 indicate above-random skill. The thesis reports PC@k and PC-lift@k jointly because aggregate PC@k can be inflated by a recommender that simply tilts toward the largest asset band (Income, in our case), while PC-lift@k makes that inflation visible.

### 2.2 Evaluation protocol for RQ3 and RQ4

Following FAR-Trans, the model-level analysis uses 69 monthly temporal splits between August 2019 and April 2025. For each split, models are trained on interactions whose timestamp falls before the split's `time_point` and evaluated on test interactions in `[time_point, test_end]`. Per-split metrics are nDCG@10, ROI@10 (geometric 30-day-rescaled forward return averaged over the top-10), Recall@10, PC@10, and PC-lift@10. A "trial" is one fully specified hyperparameter configuration evaluated as 69 fresh train-evaluate cycles. Random Forest is tuned on a 12-trial grid over `(number_of_estimators, max_depth)` with `prediction_horizon_months = 6` and primary metric ROI@10; LightGCN is tuned on an 8-trial grid over `(embedding_dimension, number_of_layers, learning_rate)` with primary metric nDCG@10. The asset risk classification used by PC@10 is computed once on the full FAR-Trans price history; we treat this as a methodological caveat in Section 4.4. Note also the validation/evaluation window overlap caveat documented in [README.md](README.md#validationevaluation-window-overlap-known-caveat); it affects all models symmetrically and therefore does not bias relative model comparisons.

### 2.3 Transaction-level regression for RQ2

For RQ2, the unit of observation is one Buy transaction. Each Buy is joined to the closest available close price at its transaction timestamp (a `merge_asof` with backward direction and 7-day tolerance) and to the closest available close price exactly six calendar months later under the same convention. The realised return is

```
realised_return = (end_price - start_price) / start_price
```

Each transaction is annotated with `is_coherent = 1[d(u, i) <= 1]`, asset volatility (the asset's trailing 252-day annualised volatility, computed once over the full history), customer segment (`customer_type`), and the calendar year of the transaction. The fit is

```
realised_return ~ is_coherent + asset_volatility + C(customer_type) + C(year)
```

with cluster-robust standard errors clustered on `customerID`. The coefficient on `is_coherent` is the headline: it gives the conditional 6-month return gap between coherent and discordant Buys for a typical customer-year-volatility cell. Out of 228,913 Buys, 208,029 (90.9%) survive the joint join (forward price within tolerance, both bands present, customer segment present, volatility computable), so the panel covers 27,873 unique customers. RQ2 is *quasi-causal* in the sense that observable confounders are adjusted for through the controls, but unobservable factors (customer attention, exogenous information shocks, channel-level effects) are not, so the coefficient should be read as the conditional association rather than as a causal effect.

### 2.4 Model panel regression for RQ3

The model-level regression takes each baseline's best-trial recommendation parquet, reduces it to one row per (customer, split) carrying the customer's coherent share for that split, and stacks the two model panels. The fit is

```
coherent_share ~ C(declared_band) * C(model) + C(split_index)
```

with cluster-robust standard errors clustered on `customer_id`. The interaction coefficients `C(declared_band)[T.b]:C(model)[T.random_forest]` quantify how Random Forest shifts each band's coherence relative to the reference cell (Conservative band, LightGCN). Predictions are reported at the median split index (36) of the unbalanced panel (the eligible-customer set varies by split), which serves as a representative middle-of-window time point.

### 2.5 Stratified profile-coherent LightGCN for RQ4

RQ4 is a method-axis intervention. Two design decisions distinguish it from the global RQ3 baseline. First, **stratification**: rather than training one global LightGCN over the full customer-asset bipartite graph, the architecture maintains four independent sub-models, one per declared MiFID risk band (Conservative, Income, Balanced, Aggressive). Each sub-model is trained on the sub-graph induced by customers in its band and the full asset universe, so the recommender can specialise the embedding geometry to the subpopulation. Customers without a usable risk band are routed to the Balanced sub-model at inference time, matching the centre-of-distribution prior used in regulator-aligned imputation.

Second, a **profile-coherent margin loss** is added to the BPR objective. For each training step on a sub-model targeting band `b`, two assets are sampled per customer: an asset whose risk band lies within tolerance of `b` (`coherent`, drawn from the asset-band-conditional pool with `|b_i - b| <= 1`), and an asset whose risk band lies at or beyond two ordinal steps (`discordant`, `|b_i - b| >= 2`). The loss is

```
L = L_BPR + L_L2 + lambda * mean( softplus(score_discordant - score_coherent) )
```

where `score_x` is the dot product of the customer embedding with the asset embedding under the standard LightGCN propagation, and `lambda` is the profile-coherent loss weight. `lambda = 0` recovers a pure stratified LightGCN with no explicit coherence pressure (the **ablation** trial); `lambda = 1` is the **treatment** trial used as the headline configuration. Both trials share the LightGCN backbone hyperparameters from the RQ3 best trial (`embedding_dimension = 64, number_of_layers = 3, learning_rate = 1e-3, weight_decay = 1e-5, keep_probability = 0.6, number_of_epochs = 50, batch_size = 1024`), so any difference between λ=0 and λ=1 is attributable to the coherence pressure rather than to a hyperparameter accident, and the difference between λ=0 and the RQ3 LightGCN baseline is attributable to stratification alone.

Both trials are evaluated on the same 69 monthly temporal splits used in RQ1-RQ3, with the same metrics (nDCG@10, ROI@10, Recall@10, PC@10, PC-lift@10), so the comparison against the global LightGCN baseline is paired at the per-split level. Three contrasts are reported in Section 3.4: (i) λ=0 versus the RQ3 LightGCN baseline, isolating the stratification effect; (ii) λ=1 versus the RQ3 LightGCN baseline, the headline practitioner-relevant comparison; (iii) λ=1 versus λ=0, isolating the profile-coherent loss effect under matched architecture and hyperparameters. The per-band decomposition mirrors Section 3.3's panel layout: PC@10 is averaged across customer-split rows for each declared band, then divided by `pi(b)` to give a band-conditional lift.

## 3. Findings

### 3.1 RQ1: profile-discordance is prevalent and structural

Across 228,241 scoreable Buy transactions (99.7% of the 228,913 raw Buys carry both customer band and asset band), the discordance distribution is:

| Discordance `d` | Count | Share |
|---|---:|---:|
| `d = 0` (exact match) | 77,925 | 34.1% |
| `d = 1` (within tolerance) | 107,899 | 47.3% |
| `d = 2` | 35,581 | 15.6% |
| `d = 3` (extreme mismatch) | 6,836 | 3.0% |

Under the default tolerance (`d <= 1`), **81.4% of Buy transactions are profile-coherent**, so 18.6% (42,417 Buys) violate the declared MiFID band by 2 or more steps. Mean discordance is 0.87 bands. The discordance is *not* spread uniformly across the customer base: per-customer self-discordance is sharply bimodal, with **64.4% of customers fully coherent** (every Buy at `d <= 1`), **17.2% fully discordant** (every Buy at `d >= 2`), and **20.3% above 50% discordance**. The middle of the per-customer distribution is sparse, so most customers transact in the band that the questionnaire predicts (or systematically outside it) rather than alternating. This bimodality is the strongest empirical motivation for treating profile alignment as a load-bearing recommender axis.

The discordance is concentrated on the two ordinal extremes:

| Declared MiFID band | Transactions | Coherent share (`d <= 1`) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Conservative | 14,193 | **45.1%** |
| Income | 73,468 | 90.9% |
| Balanced | 99,901 | 89.9% |
| Aggressive | 40,679 | **56.2%** |

Mid-band customers (Income, Balanced) are roughly 90% coherent. Conservative and Aggressive customers are dramatically less coherent: more than half of Conservative customers' Buys land at `d >= 2` (chasing risk), and 44% of Aggressive customers' Buys land in safer assets than their declared profile would permit. The pattern is consistent with regression-toward-the-centre under loss aversion (Aggressive customers reaching for yield-bearing safer assets) and with reach-for-yield under low rates (Conservative customers buying riskier products).

Two further audit slices rule out competing explanations. Mean discordance per calendar year stays inside the 0.83-0.98 band across 2018-2022 (`outputs/eda/discordance_by_year.png`); the COVID-19 drawdown and recovery do not visibly shift the pattern, ruling out a "panic trading drove the discordance" reading. Mean discordance by `customerType` ranges from 0.81 (Professional) to 1.52 (Legal Entity), with Mass at 0.85 and Premium at 0.91, so the trait is segment-driven rather than regime-driven. A volatility-only sensitivity mapping (no subcategory metadata, all assets binned by quartile) shifts the headline `d <= 1` rate from 81.4% down to 73.2% and the mean discordance from 0.87 up to 1.03; the qualitative findings are robust to the mapping convention while absolute coherence levels are not.

The audit therefore answers RQ1: profile-discordance in FAR-Trans is prevalent (18.6% of Buys), a customer-level trait rather than transaction-level noise (bimodal self-discordance, U-shaped band decomposition), and stable across the 2018-2022 macro window. Full numerics are in `outputs/eda/summary.json`.

### 3.2 RQ2: profile-coherent transactions earn higher realised return

The transaction-level OLS over the 208,029-Buy panel (27,873 unique customers; coherent share 81.3%) has the following key coefficients, with cluster-robust standard errors clustered on `customerID`:

| Term | Estimate | Std. error | 95% CI | p-value |
|---|---:|---:|---|---:|
| `is_coherent` | **+0.0294** | 0.0040 | [+0.0215, +0.0372] | 2.3e-13 |
| `asset_volatility` | -0.1025 | 0.0165 | [-0.1349, -0.0701] | 5.5e-10 |
| `C(year)[T.2020]` | +0.2107 | 0.0061 | [+0.1986, +0.2227] | 6.2e-259 |
| `C(year)[T.2022]` | -0.0195 | 0.0045 | [-0.0283, -0.0107] | 1.4e-05 |
| `Intercept` | -0.0471 | 0.0141 | [-0.0746, -0.0195] | 8.1e-04 |

Customer-type fixed effects (`Mass`, `Premium`, `Professional`, `Legal Entity`) are not individually significant; the intercept absorbs the omitted category (`Inactive`). The full coefficient table is in `outputs/analysis/transaction_return_regression/20260504_004849/coefficients.csv`.

The headline reading: **conditional on asset volatility, customer segment, and year, profile-coherent Buy transactions earn 2.94 percentage points more 6-month realised return than profile-discordant ones.** The raw slice means are even larger (coherent +4.23%, discordant +0.92%), so the controls absorb roughly 0.4 pp of the unconditional 3.3 pp gap and the residual 2.9 pp is the conditional association. The asset-volatility coefficient is negative as expected (more volatile assets earned lower 6-month forward returns over the sample window). The 2020 fixed effect captures the post-COVID equity rally, and the negative 2022 effect captures the bond drawdown and the equity correction.

The direction is the opposite of the implicit assumption baked into FAR's "profit-versus-preference" framing. RQ2 was posed as "do discordant transactions earn lower returns?" anticipating that the regulator-aligned trades might be the worse trades and that profile coherence would be a regulatory tax. On FAR-Trans the answer is the reverse: **profile-discordant transactions earn lower returns**, the gap is statistically tight (p < 1e-12 under cluster-robust inference on customerID), and the magnitude is economically meaningful at roughly 6 pp annualised. This reframes the problem facing FAR systems: profile coherence is not an axis traded off against return, but an axis that is positively correlated with return on the customer side once observable confounders are absorbed. Whether the field's recommenders preserve this alignment is a separate question, addressed in RQ3.

### 3.3 RQ3: both FAR-Trans baselines under-serve declared-band coherence

After full grid search, the two baselines reach the following at their primary-metric optima:

| Model | Best trial | nDCG@10 | ROI@10 (%/mo) | Recall@10 | PC@10 | PC-lift@10 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| LightGCN | eb788_00006 | 0.330 | -0.54 | 0.495 | 0.794 | 1.171 |
| Random Forest | df0bd_00008 | 0.019 | +1.42 | 0.036 | 0.667 | 1.060 |

The LightGCN best-trial backbone is `embedding_dimension = 64, number_of_layers = 3, learning_rate = 1e-3, weight_decay = 1e-5, keep_probability = 0.6, number_of_epochs = 50, batch_size = 1024`; the Random Forest best trial is `number_of_estimators = 40, max_depth = 50, prediction_horizon_months = 6`. Both clear the unconditional random baseline `pi(b_u)` averaged over the customer mix, but aggregate PC@10 hides the per-band picture.

The model panel regression (Section 2.4) predicts the following PC at the median split (36), with cluster-robust 95% confidence intervals on `customer_id`:

| Band | `pi(b)` | LightGCN | LGCN lift | Random Forest | RF lift |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Conservative | 0.649 | 0.520 | **0.80x** | 0.374 | **0.58x** |
| Income | 0.779 | 0.919 | 1.18x | 0.579 | **0.74x** |
| Balanced | 0.764 | 0.926 | 1.21x | 0.821 | 1.07x |
| Aggressive | 0.351 | 0.508 | 1.45x | 0.697 | 1.99x |

LightGCN is below the random baseline for the Conservative band (lift 0.80x). Random Forest is below random for Conservative (0.58x) **and** Income (0.74x). These two bands together cover 17,510 of 28,770 customers with a usable risk band (5,672 Conservative + 11,838 Income, declared and predicted), or 60.9% of the eligible population once the 320 `Not_Available` customers are removed. Every cell shift is statistically significant against the reference (Conservative, LightGCN) at p < 1e-9 under cluster-robust inference (full coefficient table in `outputs/analysis/panel_regression/20260504_003145/coefficients.csv`). The two interaction coefficients that drive the per-band conclusions are `C(declared_band)[T.3]:C(model)[T.random_forest] = +0.334` (RF over-serves the Aggressive band by +33 pp relative to the Conservative-LightGCN reference) and `C(declared_band)[T.1]:C(model)[T.random_forest] = -0.195` (RF under-serves Income by -19 pp). The forest plot is in `outputs/analysis/panel_regression/20260504_003145/forest_predicted_pc.png`.

A second view comes from decomposing each model's recommendation pool into coherent and discordant slices and computing simple mean monthly return on each slice, across all 1,372,010 customer-split-slot recommendations (`outputs/analysis/baseline_decomposition/20260427_122215/decomposition.csv`):

| Model | Coherent share | Coherent ROI (%/mo) | Discordant ROI (%/mo) | Overall ROI (%/mo) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| LightGCN | 0.794 | -0.84 | -0.54 | -0.78 |
| Random Forest | 0.665 | +1.67 | +0.80 | +1.38 |

LightGCN's coherent slice underperforms its discordant slice by 0.30 pp/month, the model-level inversion of the transaction-level finding in Section 3.2: the recommendations LightGCN is willing to label coherent are not the same population as the coherent transactions in the underlying data. Random Forest preserves the transaction-level direction (coherent slice + 0.87 pp/month over discordant) but at a low aggregate PC level (0.665) and with the per-band failure profile shown above, where the +1.42%/month ROI advantage is concentrated on the Aggressive band (+1.99x lift) where RF over-serves by 33 pp.

The findings answer RQ3 affirmatively: existing FAR baselines under-serve declared-band coherence, the failures fall on Conservative (both models) and Income (Random Forest only), together covering 60.9% of the eligible population, and neither baseline reaches `pi(b_u)` for every band simultaneously.

### 3.4 RQ4: stratification plus profile-coherent loss closes the per-band coverage deficit

The two stratified configurations reach the following 69-split averages, with the RQ3 LightGCN best trial (`eb788_00006`) included as the global-baseline reference:

| Configuration | nDCG@10 | ROI@10 (raw mo.) | Recall@10 | PC@10 | PC-lift@10 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| LightGCN baseline (RQ3, `eb788_00006`) | 0.3295 | -0.0054 | 0.4946 | 0.7940 | 1.171 |
| Stratified, λ=0 (ablation) | 0.3317 | -0.0073 | 0.5009 | 0.8215 | 1.189 |
| Stratified, λ=1 (treatment) | 0.3094 | -0.0071 | 0.4671 | 0.9182 | 1.397 |

Per-split paired deltas against the RQ3 baseline (mean delta over 69 splits, fraction of splits on which the stratified configuration wins):

| Contrast | nDCG@10 | ROI@10 | Recall@10 | PC@10 | PC-lift@10 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Stratified λ=0 vs baseline | +0.0022 (57%) | -0.0019 (28%) | +0.0063 (72%) | **+0.0275 (100%)** | +0.019 (90%) |
| Stratified λ=1 vs baseline | -0.0201 (7%) | -0.0018 (33%) | -0.0275 (7%) | **+0.1242 (100%)** | +0.226 (100%) |
| Stratified λ=1 vs λ=0 (PC-loss only) | -0.0223 (0%) | +0.0001 (58%) | -0.0338 (0%) | **+0.0968 (100%)** | +0.207 (100%) |

The contrasts decompose cleanly. **Stratification alone is approximately free.** Replacing the global LightGCN with four band-stratified sub-models (no profile-coherent loss) lifts aggregate PC@10 by +2.7 pp on every one of the 69 splits without an nDCG penalty (mean delta +0.0022, win rate 57%) and with a slight Recall improvement (mean +0.006, win rate 72%). ROI moves -0.2 pp/month, a small absolute regression with a 28% per-split win rate. **The profile-coherent loss buys most of the headline lift at predictable cost.** Adding `lambda = 1` on top of the stratified architecture lifts aggregate PC@10 by a further +9.7 pp on every split, at a cost of -2.2 pp nDCG@10 and -3.4 pp Recall@10 on every split. ROI is essentially unchanged: the per-split mean delta is +0.0001 with a 58% win rate, well inside the standard error of the per-split ROI estimator.

The per-band decomposition (mean PC@10 across customer-split rows in the eligible-customer panel of 137,038 customer-split observations, with `pi(b)` and lift) is the load-bearing finding for the regulator-alignment question:

| Declared band | Eligible cells | `pi(b)` | LightGCN baseline | Strat λ=0 | Strat λ=1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Conservative | 5,348 | 0.649 | 0.484 (**0.75x**) | 0.590 (0.91x) | **0.774 (1.19x)** |
| Income | 45,142 | 0.779 | 0.884 (1.13x) | 0.937 (1.20x) | 0.982 (1.26x) |
| Balanced | 61,181 | 0.764 | 0.890 (1.16x) | 0.929 (1.22x) | 0.981 (1.28x) |
| Aggressive | 25,367 | 0.351 | 0.473 (1.35x) | 0.411 (1.17x) | **0.692 (1.97x)** |

Three observations:

1. **The Conservative-band sub-random failure flagged in RQ3 is fixed under λ=1.** Baseline LightGCN's Conservative-band coverage is 0.484 (lift 0.75x), the headline RQ3 deficit. Stratification alone narrows the gap to 0.590 (lift 0.91x), still slightly sub-random. The profile-coherent loss lifts coverage all the way to 0.774 (lift 1.19x), the first configuration in this thesis where every declared band sits at or above the band-conditional random baseline. The Conservative band gains roughly 30 pp PC@10 from stratification plus PC-loss combined, and roughly 19 pp from PC-loss alone (after stratification has already moved 11 pp).

2. **The Aggressive band gains the most under PC-loss but actually regresses under stratification alone.** The Aggressive sub-model (λ=0) lands at 0.411 (lift 1.17x), below the global baseline's 0.473 (1.35x). The stratified architecture by itself does not push the Aggressive sub-model toward coherent assets; it specialises on a sub-graph but the asset-side training signal is unchanged from a global LightGCN. Adding the profile-coherent loss takes Aggressive coverage to 0.692 (lift 1.97x), the largest absolute and relative gain across bands. Aggressive is the band with the smallest `pi(b)` (0.351), so it is the band where the recommender has the most room to demonstrate skill above random sampling, and the band where the PC-loss does the most work.

3. **The two centre bands (Income, Balanced) gain modestly and uniformly from each component.** Income coverage moves 0.884 → 0.937 → 0.982 (lift 1.13x → 1.20x → 1.26x); Balanced coverage moves 0.890 → 0.929 → 0.981 (lift 1.16x → 1.22x → 1.28x). Both are already above random under the global baseline, so the profile-coherent intervention pushes them toward the ceiling rather than fixing a deficit.

The aggregate ROI@10 picture is small in magnitude but not at the noise floor. A paired t-test on the 69-split per-split ROI deltas gives `lambda = 0` versus baseline at -0.00191/month (t = -4.41, p = 4.1e-5) and `lambda = 1` versus baseline at -0.00175/month (t = -3.82, p = 3e-4), both statistically distinguishable from zero with the baseline winning roughly two splits out of three. The pure profile-coherent loss effect (`lambda = 1` versus `lambda = 0`) is +0.00015/month with t = +0.96, p = 0.34, win rate 58%, which is statistically indistinguishable from zero. The aggregate ROI penalty is therefore attributable to stratification rather than to the coherence loss: adding the loss on top of an already-stratified architecture does not move aggregate ROI in either direction.

The per-band ROI decomposition reveals where the small aggregate penalty comes from and where it is reversed:

| Declared band | Slate cells | Baseline ROI (mo.) | Strat λ=1 ROI (mo.) | Δ ROI (λ=1 − baseline) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Conservative | 53,480 | -0.00752 | -0.00453 | **+0.30 pp/mo** |
| Income | 451,420 | -0.00724 | -0.00617 | +0.11 pp/mo |
| Balanced | 611,810 | -0.00777 | -0.01013 | -0.24 pp/mo |
| Aggressive | 253,670 | -0.00890 | -0.01669 | **-0.78 pp/mo** |

The two regulator-critical bands (Conservative and Income, which were the two sub-random bands in RQ3) **gain ROI** under the stratified profile-coherent extension: +0.30 pp/month on Conservative and +0.11 pp/month on Income. The Aggressive band loses -0.78 pp/month, and Balanced loses -0.24 pp/month, which together dominate the slate-weighted aggregate (the Aggressive and Balanced slates are ~70% of total recommendation cells). The pattern is consistent with the macro composition of FAR-Trans's evaluation window: safer assets (the Conservative-tolerated set, roughly `{Conservative, Income}`) outperformed riskier assets over 2019-2025, so an architecture that pushes Conservative-band recommendations toward safer assets earns return, while an architecture that pushes Aggressive-band recommendations toward riskier assets gives up return. This echoes the RQ2 customer-side finding: profile-coherent customer behaviour was associated with higher realised return in this dataset, and the model-side intervention preserves the same direction on the two bands where the deficit originally lived.

The net answer to RQ4: a stratified profile-coherent LightGCN achieves +12.4 pp aggregate PC@10 (100% per-split win rate over the global LightGCN baseline) and lifts every declared band to at-or-above its `pi(b)` baseline simultaneously, at a cost of -2 pp nDCG@10 and -3 pp Recall@10. Aggregate ROI@10 falls -0.18 pp/month, a small but statistically detectable penalty driven by stratification rather than by the coherence loss; per-band, ROI **improves** on Conservative (+0.30 pp/mo) and Income (+0.11 pp/mo) and **regresses** on Balanced (-0.24 pp/mo) and Aggressive (-0.78 pp/mo), a sign-flipped pattern that reflects the FAR-Trans macro window. The decomposition shows the architecture earns a cheap +2.7 pp PC@10 from stratification (no nDCG cost) and an expensive +9.7 pp PC@10 from the coherence loss (nDCG -2 pp, Recall -3 pp); the coherence loss itself does not move aggregate ROI. For deployments where regulator alignment is binding, the trade is favourable: the recommender remains a competitive ranker (nDCG 0.31, Recall 0.47), moves every band off sub-random coverage, and improves realised return on the precise customer bands the regulation was designed to protect. Full numerics are in `outputs/results/tuning/pc_lgcn/20260505_125105.csv` and `outputs/results/evaluation/pc_lgcn/20260505_125105/`.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Profile coherence is not a regulatory tax on FAR-Trans

The strongest framing inherited from the FAR-Trans paper is "preference versus profit": transaction-based recommenders win nDCG and lose ROI; price-based recommenders do the reverse; no method dominates either axis. A natural extension is "profile versus profit": adding a regulatory constraint must cost some return, because the constraint excludes the trades the recommender thinks are profitable. RQ2 contradicts this framing on FAR-Trans. Conditional on volatility, customer segment, and year, the *coherent* Buys earn 2.94 pp more 6-month return than the discordant Buys (p < 1e-12 under cluster-robust inference). On the customer side, profile coherence and realised return co-move in the same direction. A FAR recommender that restricted itself to profile-coherent recommendations would, in expectation under this dataset, be a higher-return recommender, not a lower-return one.

The model side does not preserve this alignment. LightGCN's coherent slice underperforms its discordant slice (Section 3.3 decomposition table), so LightGCN is recovering a different population in its coherent recommendations than the population of coherent transactions in the data. Random Forest preserves the direction (coherent slice +0.87 pp/month over discordant) but with a per-band coverage failure on Conservative and Income (5,672 + 11,838 = 17,510 customers, 60.9% of the eligible population). The implication is that RQ2's finding is a property of customer behaviour in FAR-Trans, not a property the existing baselines automatically inherit.

### 4.2 Where the audit places the regulatory risk

The model-level panel regression in Section 3.3 quantifies a structurally suspect deployment risk. LightGCN's Conservative-band coverage is 0.520 against the random baseline of 0.649, i.e. 0.80x random; Random Forest's coverage is even lower at 0.374 (0.58x random). Random Forest also fails Income coverage at 0.579 (0.74x random). The two failing bands together cover 60.9% of the customer population. A naive inference from aggregate PC@10 (LightGCN 0.794, RF 0.667) hides this: the aggregates are above the population-mix-weighted random baseline because the largest customer segment (Income) sits in the asset band with the highest `pi(b)` value (0.779) and because LightGCN over-serves the Income and Balanced bands at the expense of Conservative. PC-lift@k normalisation by `pi(b_u)` makes this inflation visible at the customer level; the per-band panel regression makes it visible at the model level.

The Random Forest interaction coefficient `C(declared_band)[T.3]:C(model)[T.random_forest] = +0.334` is the largest in the regression: Random Forest over-serves Aggressive by 33 pp relative to the reference cell. It is also the model with the headline ROI advantage (+1.42%/month against LightGCN's -0.54%/month). The two facts together suggest RF's ROI advantage is concentrated on the band where it over-shoots the random baseline almost 2x, which is structurally suspect for any deployment whose suitability requirement is binding. The thesis cannot decompose the magnitude of this concentration into a "regime" component and a "skill" component without an independent benchmark in a different macro window, but the interaction coefficient places the RF-versus-LightGCN ROI gap on a cautionary footing for regulator-aligned deployment.

### 4.3 Methodological contribution: PC-lift@k normalisation

The band-conditional random baseline `pi(b)` is non-uniform on FAR-Trans because the asset universe is skewed (Income is 41% of the catalogue; Balanced is 13%; the Aggressive coherent set is 35% of total assets). Reporting raw PC@k allows a centre-tilting recommender to inflate the metric on Income and Balanced customers without delivering structural alignment. PC-lift@k makes this inflation visible: the LightGCN aggregate of 1.171 sits on a per-band lift profile of (0.80, 1.18, 1.21, 1.45) where the Conservative band is sub-random; the RF aggregate of 1.060 sits on a per-band lift profile of (0.58, 0.74, 1.07, 1.99) where two bands are sub-random. The thesis recommends reporting raw PC@k and PC-lift@k jointly in any future PC@k publication, with the basis (per-trial aggregate or panel-regression-predicted) stated explicitly.

### 4.4 What RQ4 says about the design space

RQ4 is the prescriptive complement to RQ3. The clean ablation between stratification (λ=0) and stratification-plus-coherence-loss (λ=1) decomposes the per-band coverage deficit into a structural component (the architecture sees too few same-band signals under a single global model) and a training-objective component (BPR alone has no incentive to favour coherent assets). The decomposition recovers two design-relevant facts. First, stratification alone is a low-cost coverage win: +2.7 pp aggregate PC@10 with no nDCG penalty and a 100% per-split win rate, and the Conservative band moves from 0.75x to 0.91x random; the cost is one extra training run per band, paid once per evaluation cycle. A FAR practitioner who is unwilling to introduce a new training objective can still adopt stratification as a free-lunch coverage improvement. Second, the profile-coherent margin loss is the component that does the heavy regulatory lifting. The Conservative-band move from 0.91x to 1.19x random and the Aggressive-band move from 1.17x to 1.97x random are both attributable to the loss term, not the architecture; they cost roughly 2 pp nDCG and 3 pp Recall on every split, which is a measurable but not destabilising hit to the ranking primary metric. The trade is not free, but it is bounded.

The ROI@10 result is the most nuanced model-side echo of RQ2's customer-side finding, and the aggregate-versus-per-band split matters. On aggregate, both stratified configurations regress ROI by a small but statistically detectable margin (-0.18 to -0.19 pp/month vs the RQ3 baseline, paired t-test p ≤ 3e-4); the coherence loss itself contributes essentially nothing to that aggregate move (`lambda = 1` versus `lambda = 0` paired t-test p = 0.34, mean delta +0.0001/month). The aggregate penalty is therefore an architectural cost of stratification (smaller per-band training graphs, narrower embedding geometry) rather than a regulatory tax imposed by the coherence loss.

The per-band decomposition is sign-flipped across the customer mix and is the stronger echo of RQ2. The two regulator-critical bands (Conservative, Income) gain ROI under the stratified profile-coherent extension (+0.30 and +0.11 pp/month), and the Balanced and Aggressive bands lose ROI (-0.24 and -0.78 pp/month). The asymmetry is consistent with the FAR-Trans macro window, in which safer assets generally outperformed riskier ones, so pushing Conservative recommendations toward Conservative-tolerated assets is a return-positive move while pushing Aggressive recommendations toward Aggressive-tolerated assets is a return-negative move. The recommender's coherent slice is not a worse-trade slice; the bands where coherence is hardest to achieve (Aggressive, with a `pi(b) = 0.351` and a tolerated set that excludes the best-performing assets in the sample window) are the bands where ROI regresses most. A cautionary note: ROI@10 in this dataset is a small per-month quantity centred near zero, so the absence of a measurable aggregate PC-vs-ROI trade-off from the coherence loss is partly a power statement (the available signal is small) and partly a structural one (the coherent asset universe on FAR-Trans does not strongly underperform on aggregate). A different macro window or a dataset where Aggressive-tolerated assets outperformed could reverse the per-band sign pattern.

The Aggressive-band asymmetry between λ=0 and λ=1 is the most interpretable design-space finding. Under stratification alone the Aggressive sub-model regresses to 0.411 PC@10 (1.17x random), worse than the global LightGCN's 0.473 (1.35x random). The training data for the Aggressive sub-graph is the smaller and most active subpopulation, but the BPR objective alone offers no signal that pushes the embedding geometry toward Aggressive-tolerated assets; the sub-model recovers transaction patterns rather than band coverage. The profile-coherent loss is what supplies the missing signal, and the gain is the largest of any band (1.97x random, the highest cell in the entire table). The pattern suggests that PC-loss and stratification are complements rather than substitutes on FAR-Trans: stratification narrows the embedding geometry per band, and the loss reorients that geometry toward coherent assets. Removing either component leaves a structural gap on at least one band.

### 4.5 Limitations

The findings inherit FAR-Trans's specifics. The asset universe is small (806 assets) and biased toward European listings. The customer base is retail rather than institutional. The temporal window includes the COVID drawdown, the 2022 yield-spike regime, and the 2023-2025 recovery, which is representative but not exhaustive macro spread.

The hierarchical risk-class mapping over assets relies on subcategory metadata that is denser for mutual funds than for stocks, where a volatility-quartile fallback is used. The volatility-only sensitivity (`outputs/eda/summary.json`'s `sensitivity_volatility_only_summary`) shifts the dataset's overall coherence rate by roughly 8 pp (0.81 to 0.73), so absolute per-band PC values are sensitive to the mapping convention while the qualitative audit findings of Section 3.1 are robust under both conventions. The asset risk classification used throughout this thesis is computed once on the full FAR-Trans price history. For PC@k as a metric this is interpretable (alignment to the canonical end-of-dataset risk classification matches how a regulator-aligned suitability check would treat a "currently Aggressive" stock). The transaction-return regression in RQ2 uses the same end-of-dataset volatility for the `asset_volatility` control, which is a mild lookahead; a fully time-honest sensitivity check that recomputes asset volatility per transaction date is left to future work.

The RQ2 regression is *quasi-causal*: observable confounders (asset volatility, customer segment, year) are absorbed, but unobservable confounders are not. The regression cannot distinguish "coherent transactions are better trades because the customer's questionnaire-derived risk band is correlated with skill or attention" from "coherent transactions are better trades because the asset properties implied by the customer's tolerated band are systematically rewarded over the sample window". The 2020 fixed effect of +21 pp is consistent with the latter reading (the pandemic recovery was strongest in equities, which sit in the band the largest customer segment tolerates), but the residual `is_coherent` coefficient of +2.9 pp after year fixed effects suggests there is something beyond regime composition.

The FAR-Trans evaluation protocol has a known overlap between validation and early evaluation splits documented in the [Validation/Evaluation Window Overlap](README.md#validationevaluation-window-overlap-known-caveat) section of the project README. The substantive comparisons in Section 3.3 are within-protocol so the caveat affects both models symmetrically; absolute per-split metric levels should be read with this caveat in mind.

The RQ4 stratified extension inherits the LightGCN backbone hyperparameters of the RQ3 best trial rather than tuning a fresh grid. The choice was deliberate: it isolates the architecture-and-loss intervention from a confounding hyperparameter search and keeps the comparison against the RQ3 baseline paired and clean. A consequence is that the Section 3.4 numbers may understate the achievable PC@10 of the stratified architecture (a per-band hyperparameter search could lift coverage further), and the nDCG@10 cost reported there is an upper bound (a tuned per-band configuration might recover some of the -2 pp ranking penalty). Section 3.4 should be read as a single-point measurement on the design surface, not as a Pareto-optimal one. The asymmetric Aggressive-band response under λ=0 is also a clue that band-conditional hyperparameter search would be valuable future work.

## 5. Conclusion

This thesis introduced Profile Coherence at k as a regulator-aligned risk-band evaluation axis for Financial Asset Recommendation, with a band-conditional normalisation (PC-lift@k) that makes the metric scale-invariant across customer segments. PC@k captures the risk-band dimension of MiFID II suitability and does not address the other suitability axes (investment horizon, capacity, knowledge and experience, sustainability preferences); a comprehensive suitability metric for FAR systems would compose multiple alignment terms of which PC@k is one.

Four findings emerge from the FAR-Trans audit. **RQ1**: profile-discordance is prevalent (18.6% of 228,241 scoreable Buys), a customer-level trait rather than transaction-level noise (64.4% of customers are fully coherent and 17.2% are fully discordant), and concentrated on the two ordinal-extreme declared bands (Conservative 45.1% coherent, Aggressive 56.2% coherent). **RQ2**: conditional on asset volatility, customer segment, and year, profile-coherent Buys earn 2.94 percentage points more 6-month realised return than profile-discordant ones, with cluster-robust 95% CI [+2.15, +3.72] pp and p < 1e-12; profile coherence is not a regulatory tax on FAR-Trans, it is positively correlated with realised return. **RQ3**: at their primary-metric optima, LightGCN's predicted PC at split 36 is below the band-conditional random baseline for the Conservative band, and Random Forest's is below random for Conservative and Income, which together cover 60.9% of the eligible population. Random Forest's headline ROI advantage of +1.42%/month is concentrated on the Aggressive band where it over-serves the random baseline nearly 2x, which places the ROI advantage on a structurally suspect footing for a regulator-aligned deployment. **RQ4**: a stratified, profile-coherent LightGCN extension lifts aggregate PC@10 from 0.794 to 0.918 (PC-lift 1.17 to 1.40, 100% per-split win rate over the RQ3 LightGCN baseline) and moves every declared band from at-or-below to above the band-conditional random baseline (Conservative 0.484 to 0.774, lift 0.75x to 1.19x; Aggressive 0.473 to 0.692, lift 1.35x to 1.97x), at a measured cost of -2 pp nDCG@10 and -3 pp Recall@10 and a small aggregate ROI@10 penalty of -0.18 pp/month attributable to stratification rather than to the coherence loss. Per-band, ROI@10 improves on the two regulator-critical bands the RQ3 audit flagged (Conservative +0.30 pp/month, Income +0.11 pp/month) and regresses on Balanced and Aggressive (-0.24 and -0.78 pp/month). The clean ablation between λ=0 and λ=1 attributes +2.7 pp of the PC@10 gain to stratification alone (no nDCG penalty) and +9.7 pp to the profile-coherent margin loss (the bounded ranking-quality cost), with the loss itself contributing nothing measurable to aggregate ROI.

The headline outcome for the field is that the profile-coherence axis is not antagonistic to the return axis on FAR-Trans at the customer level, the existing FAR baselines do not preserve this alignment in their recommendations, and a stratified profile-coherent LightGCN extension can close the per-band coverage deficit without a measurable cost on realised return. The natural follow-ups are a band-conditional hyperparameter search (Section 4.5) and a multi-axis suitability metric that composes risk-band coverage with horizon, capacity, and sustainability terms; PC@k is the first such axis on which a regulator-aligned recommender can be both audited and trained.
