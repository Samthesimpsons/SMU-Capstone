# Aligning Financial Asset Recommendations with Investor Risk Profiles via Profile Coherence

A measurement framework for profile-aware financial asset recommendation on the FAR-Trans dataset. The work introduces **Profile Coherence at k (PC@k)** as a new evaluation axis, audits how profile-coherent existing FAR baselines (Random Forest, LightGCN) actually are, and proposes a stratified profile-coherent LightGCN extension as a prescriptive intervention.

## Paper and Findings

- **Conference writeup**: LaTeX sources live in `thesis/`. `ijcai26.pdf` is the compiled output and `sections/` contains the per-section sources. Figures are loaded from `thesis/figures/`.
- **Figure export**: `uv run poe figures` renders every findings figure (RQ1 to RQ4) as a single-column PDF into `thesis/figures/`. All renderers live in `src/analysis/findings.py`.

This README is the engineering counterpart: project context, code architecture, reproduction instructions.

## FAR-Trans Context

This section summarises the FAR-Trans paper that forms the dataset and baseline foundation of this project.

### What is FAR?

Financial Asset Recommendation (FAR) identifies and ranks financial securities for investors based on their suitability.

Suitability depends on:

| Factor | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Investor-side** | Past transactions, risk tolerance, investment capacity, personal goals |
| **Market-side** | Asset returns, currency value, inflation |

FAR systems analyse multiple data sources:

- Time series pricing data
- Customer profile data
- Past investment transactions

### Paper Contribution

Most existing FAR models are developed over **proprietary or simulated datasets**, making fair comparison across methods impossible. The only prior public dataset (ObjectWay, Musto et al. 2014) has 1,172 users but **lacks pricing data and asset identifiers**, which prevents price-based approaches from being tested.

**[FAR-Trans](https://doi.org/10.5525/gla.researchdata.1658) (Sanz-Cruzado et al., 2024) fills this gap**: the first public dataset for FAR that contains both real asset pricing information and real retail investor transactions, collected from a large European financial institution (the National Bank of Greece) and covering January 2018 to November 2022. The paper also provides a **benchmark comparison of 11 FAR algorithms** as baselines for future research.

## Working with this Repository

### Prerequisites

- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)**: package and dependency manager

### Setup

```sh
uv sync                               # Install dependencies
uv run poe setup                      # Install lefthook git hooks that runs the precommit and postcommit checks
source .venv/bin/activate             # Activate the virtual environment
```

Here is a summary of what the lefthook git hooks does:
- **Pre-commit**: lint, format, typecheck.

### Common Tasks

```sh
uv run poe preprocess                                                         # generate temporal evaluation splits to data/splits/
uv run poe eda                                                                # dataset audit -> outputs/eda/
uv run poe tune --splits-limit 2 --device cpu                                 # RQ1-RQ3 smoke test using cpu and small subset of data
uv run poe stratify --splits-limit 2 --device cpu                             # RQ4 stratified PC-LightGCN smoke test
uv run poe jlab                                                               # launch Jupyter Lab to open notebooks/findings.ipynb
uv run poe figures                                                            # export all thesis figures as PDFs into thesis/figures/
uv run poe lint                                                               # ruff linting
uv run poe type                                                               # ty type checks
uv run poe format                                                             # ruff format
```

### Reproducing the Work

Run the following `poe` tasks in order from the project root:

```sh
uv run poe setup        # install lefthook git hooks (precommit/postcommit checks)
uv run poe preprocess   # generate temporal evaluation splits to data/splits/
uv run poe eda          # dataset audit -> outputs/eda/
uv run poe tune         # RQ1-RQ3: baseline grid + decomposition + RQ2 + RQ3
uv run poe stratify     # RQ4: stratified profile-coherent LightGCN
uv run poe figures      # export all thesis figures as single-column PDFs into thesis/figures/
```

After the figures export, rebuild the LaTeX paper to pick up the regenerated figures:

```sh
cd thesis && latexmk -pdf ijcai26.tex
```

> **Note**: the SLURM batch scripts described in [GPU Cluster](#gpu-cluster) are only relevant if you have access to the SMU GPU cluster. In that case, `sbatch scripts/tune.sh` and `sbatch scripts/stratify.sh` replace the corresponding `poe` tasks (`tune` and `stratify`).

## GPU Cluster

The SMU `msc` partition under `studentqos` is the standard target for the grid sweep. SSH via my personal email: `samuel.sim.2024@origami.smu.edu.sg` (GlobalVPN set-up required).

### Submitting the Pipeline

```bash
sbatch scripts/tune.sh         # RQ1-RQ3: baseline grid + decomposition + Regression Studies
sbatch scripts/stratify.sh     # RQ4: stratified profile-coherent LightGCN
```

Both scripts load the cluster Python and CUDA modules, activate the venv, and invoke the matching `poe` task (`tune` or `stratify`).

Job email notifications go to the addresses listed in the `#SBATCH --mail-user` line. Live job output streams to `outputs/{user}.{jobid}.out` on the cluster filesystem.

### Useful Commands

```bash
myinfo                  # Account details, quotas, partition info
myqueue                 # Status of current jobs
myjob <jobid>           # Detailed info on a running/recent job (last 5 min)
mypastjob <days>        # Job history for the past N days (max 30)
```
